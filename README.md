# HomeFlow

HomeFlow is an up-to-date, contemporary build of WiiFlow_lite - Einstien Mod - with the capacity to use a custom IOS hidden and blocked from the user - later editions will have this capacity entirely removed.

Why?
Much of the last five years of homebrew development, particularly in emulation, has centered around "WiiFlow" - the leading exponent of  coverflows - dancing arrays of dvd sized, game-launching covers, framed by a dynamic camera, in a 3D space... In expanding it's function from a backup loader to loading games for emulators, WiiFlow evolved a sophisticated and stable means of handling arguments
- Although orginally intended to load games, any homebrew that can use arguments can, in effect, use wiiflow's "coverflows" as an exceptionally beautiful, point and click - icon interface.

WiiFlow was originally concieved as a means of accessing backup disks using a custom IOS - Nintendo code edited and reinstalled in a different IOS 'slot'. A custom IOS is, by definition, a copyright infringement; and this means WiiFlow, in it's standard published form, cannot be published on many legitimate sites.

This includes the home of the homebrew channel, Wii homebrew portal, and first google hit for "wii homebrew" - Wiibrew.

- By removing 'illegal' content, HomeFlow can take many of the plugins and other content Wiiflow and PLugin developers, and others, have worked on over the years, and present it to an audience excluded by WiiFlow's illegitimacy, and
- By presenting HomeFlow not just as an app or content launcher, but as a ready made front end for any homebrew that can handle arguments, 
- and by illustrating the possibilities that "HomeFlow" allows by using my experince building a plugin infrastructure for "QuakeGX" - and a flash game opera launcher, based on the outdated "bookmarks" wiiflow plugin -
- I  hope to inspire coders to generate more homebrew, and users like me to exploit it.
